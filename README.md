# Go NoSQL DB
NoSQL implementation in Go for learning purpose using the article 
[Build a NoSQL Database From Scratch in 1000 Lines of Code](https://betterprogramming.pub/build-a-nosql-database-from-the-scratch-in-1000-lines-of-code-8ed1c15ed924). The original implementation is also available on GitHub, see [LibraDB](https://github.com/amit-davidson/LibraDB).

## I was only interested in the concept of a NoSQL databases and concepts, so I skipped the tests implementation and code clean-up. Check out the referred article article and repo to get a full implemented project.

# Go NoSQL DB
NoSQL implementation in Go for learning purpose using the article 
[Build a NoSQL Database From Scratch in 1000 Lines of Code](https://betterprogramming.pub/build-a-nosql-database-from-the-scratch-in-1000-lines-of-code-8ed1c15ed924). The original implementation is also available on GitHub, see [LibraDB](https://github.com/amit-davidson/LibraDB).

## NOTE
I was only interested in the concept of a NoSQL databases and concepts, so I skipped the tests implementation and code clean-up. 
This implementation was just used as kind of pseudo code (written down with own taste), therefore it might be buggy or not functional at all.
Check out the referred article article and repo to get a full working implemented project.
